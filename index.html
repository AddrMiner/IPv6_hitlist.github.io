        <b>AddrMiner: </b> a systematic and comprehensive global active IPv6 address probing system. 

        <br>

        AddrMiner divides the IPv6 address space regions into three kinds according to the number of seed addresses to
        discover active IPv6 addresses from scratch, from few to many. AddrMiner would like to further open the door of
        IPv6 measurement studies by publicly releasing AddrMiner and sharing our data.

            The System Architecture of AddrMiner
        </div>

        <br>

        Our latest research incorporates real-world operational conditions, simplifies the system architecture, and divides it into two scenarios (seeded address scenarios and seedless address scenarios). Our latest research will be made public soon.

        <h2 id="hitlist">Our IPv6 Hitlist collection process</h2>
        We continuously monitor globally active IPv6 addresses. The growth curve of our IPv6 hitlist is depicted in the graph
        below. The activity of IPv6 addresses exhibits a temporal nature, meaning that an address may be active at one moment
        and not be used in the next. Our project focuses on identifying consistently active IPv6 addresses, so we monitor the
        activity of collected active IPv6 addresses daily. To maintain the availability of our IPv6 hitlist (with high
        activity), we regularly remove long-term inactive IPv6 addresses. For instance, on November 1, 2022, we cleaned our
        historical data collection by removing over one billion long-term inactive IPv6 addresses. We provide an IPv6 Hitlist
        service to provide active IPv6 addresses to interested researchers.

        AddrMiner-v2.0: is an improved global active IPv6 address detection system based on AddrMiner-v1.0. The specific improvements encompass
        two aspects: on the one hand, it simplifies the address detection architecture by dividing address detection into two
        detection scenarios, making it more practical for deployment. On the other hand, it introduces a multi-level association
        policy (MLAP) to enhance further the coverage and resource utilization of seedless regional detection.

        <b> Abstract.</b>
        Fast Internet-wide scanning is essential for network situational awareness and asset evaluation. However, the
        vast IPv6 address space makes brute-force scanning infeasible. Although state-of-the-art techniques have made
        effective attempts, these methods do not work in seedless regions, while the detection efficiency is low in
        regions with seeds. Moreover, the constructed hitlist with low coverage cannot truly represent the active IPv6
        address landscape of the Internet.
        <br>
        This paper introduces AddrMiner, a global active IPv6 address probing system, making IPv6 active address probing
        systematic, comprehensive, and economical. We divide the IPv6 address space regions into three kinds according
        to the number of seed addresses and propose a probing algorithm for each of them. For the regions with no seeds,
        we propose AddrMiner-N, leveraging an organization association strategy to mine active addresses. It finds
        active addresses covering 86.4K BGP prefixes, accounting for 81.6% of the probed BGP prefixes. For the regions
        with few seeds, we propose AddrMiner-F, utilizing a similarity matching strategy to probe active addresses
        further. The hit rate of active address probing is improved by 70%-150% compared to existing algorithms. For the
        regions with sufficient seeds, we propose AddrMiner-S to generate target addresses based on reinforcement
        learning dynamically. It nearly doubles the hit rate compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms. Finally, we
        deploy AddrMiner and discover 2.1 billion active IPv6 addresses, including 1.7 billion de-aliased active
        addresses and 0.4 billion aliased addresses, through continuous probing for 13 months. We would like to further
        open the door of IPv6 measurement studies by publicly releasing AddrMiner and sharing our data.

        <b> Abstract.</b>
        Fast IPv4 scanning significantly improves network measurement and security research. Nevertheless, it is
        infeasible to perform brute-force scanning of the IPv6 address space. Alternatively, one can find active IPv6
        addresses through scanning the candidate addresses generated by state-of-the-art algorithms. However, the
        probing efficiency of such algorithms is often very low. In this paper, our objective is to improve the probing
        efficiency of IPv6 addresses. We first perform a longitudinal active measurement study and build a high-quality
        dataset, hitlist, including more than 1.95B IPv6 addresses distributed in 58.2K BGP prefixes and collected over
        17 months period. Different from the previous works, we probe the announced BGP prefixes using a pattern-based
        algorithm. This results in a dataset without uneven address distribution and low active rates. Further, we
        propose an efficient address generation algorithm, DET, which builds a density space tree to learn high-density
        address regions of the seed addresses with linear time complexity and improves the active addresses' probing
        efficiency. We then compare our algorithm DET against state-of-the-art algorithms on the public hitlist and our
        hitlist by scanning 50M addresses. Our analysis shows that DET increases the de-aliased active address ratio and
        active address (including aliased addresses) ratio by 10%, and 14%, respectively. Furthermore, we develop a
        fingerprint-based method to detect aliased prefixes. The proposed method for the first time directly verifies
        whether the prefix is aliased or not. Our method finds that 10.64% of the public aliased prefixes are false
        positive.

        </h2>

        <b> Abstract.</b>
        Fast IPv4 scanning has made sufficient progress in network measurement and security research. However, it is
        infeasible to perform brute-force scanning of the IPv6 address space. We can find active IPv6 addresses through
        scanning candidate addresses generated by the state-of-the-art algorithms, whose probing efficiency of active
        IPv6 addresses, however, is still very low. In this paper, we aim to improve the probing efficiency of IPv6
        addresses in two ways. Firstly, we perform a longitudinal active measurement study over four months, building a
        high-quality dataset called hitlist with more than 1.3 billion IPv6 addresses distributed in 45.2k BGP prefixes.
        Different from previous work, we probe the announced BGP prefixes using a pattern-based algorithm, which makes
        our dataset overcome the problems of uneven address distribution and low active rate. Secondly, we propose an
        efficient address generation algorithm DET, which builds a density space tree to learn high-density address
        regions of the seed addresses in linear time and improves the probing efficiency of active addresses. On the
        public hitlist and our hitlist, we compare our algorithm DET against state-of-the-art algorithms and find that
        DET increases the de-aliased active address ratio by 10%, and active address (including aliased addresses) ratio
        by 14%, by scanning 50 million addresses.
